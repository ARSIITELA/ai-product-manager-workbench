# Xiaozhao Lab · AI Product Manager Workbench

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Xiaozhao Lab is a local AI product manager workbench with six document tasks: initiation reports, PRDs, competitive analysis, AI evaluation, prompt plans, and version roadmaps. Tasks prepare editable drafts in project conversations, and documents can be downloaded as Markdown. See the [workbench guide](packages/client/ui-layout/README.md).

This workbench extends [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), the open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com), and retains its [MIT license](LICENSE). Run this repository from source to use the custom interface.

It is built on an **everything-is-a-plugin** architecture and powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512).

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is in _developer preview_ and iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

Review the [safety notice](SAFETY.md) before running the project.

## Run

### Upstream runtime from `npm`

The npm package starts the upstream harness. Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run this workbench, open a terminal in the downloaded or cloned repository checkout:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm dsh web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.

## Community and support

- Submit feedback or bug reports through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions).
- Add the [`dsh-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) topic to your plugin repository for discoverability.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

Start with the [development guide](docs/development.md) and [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

`pnpm run dev:web` builds, serves, and rebuilds client bundles on source edits in one terminal, and `make help` lists the matching Make targets for Web and Desktop; the guide's application commands section owns the full table.
